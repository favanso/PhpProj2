## Project 2
### Stock Program

#### finish CRUD operations for Stock and Purchase

##### Stock table is just basic list, add, update, delete as we had for Person
##### On the list Purchase page, include an option to search by user ID
##### For update or delete on Purchase, you don't need to go update the user's balance 

#### Purchase:
- do a purchase
- subtract the appropriate balance from the user table
- If they don't have the balance, display an error instead
- After updating the balance, add the new row in the Purchase table with the correct details.
